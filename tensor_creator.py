====

First one object class has to be created
EX: Function1=TensorCreator1()

The class initiates with empty values, so the values of tshape, lower_limit,
upper_limit are expected as an input (input as numpy.ndarray type expected)

Function1.tshape=np.array([56,38])
Function1.lower_limit=np.array([0,0])
Function1.upper_limit=np.array([1,1])

After this three elements of the objects were introduced the element dim is 
going to be created inside Grid function, this mode is also used to evaluate 
the coherence and type of data introduced in the first part. 

So once all this data where introduced the mode Generator() has to be called.
This  mode use the function in the funcx function to generate te Tensor.
