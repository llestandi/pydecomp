"""
This code serve to create a tensor with its grid of any dimention from 
a function. 
Parameters:
    - The equation of the function that is going to be found in the first 
    function of this code. The variables must be introduced as 
    V[0],V[1]....,V[n].
    - tshape: will be a list or an ndarray with the information of how many
    values ar going to be taken in each dimention for the discretization 
    process.
    - lower_limit: The values of the inferior limits of the domain for the 
    discretization process.
    - upper_limit: The values of the superior limits of the domain for the 
    discretization process.
Returns:
    Tensor creator will return de grid that represent the domaine and the 
    desired tensor.

For more information how to use this code just type TensorCreator.help()

HELP
====

First one object class has to be created

EX: Function1=TensorCreator()

The class initiates with empty values, so the values of tshape, lower_limit,
upper_limit are expected as an input (input as numpy.ndarray or list
type expected)

Function1.tshape=[56,38]

Function1.lower_limit=[0,0]

Function1.upper_limit=[1,1]

After this three elements of the objects were introduced the element dim is 
going to be created inside Grid function, this mode is also used to evaluate 
the coherence and type of data introduced in the first part. 

So, once all this data where introduced the mode Generator() has to be called.
This  mode use the function in the funcx function to generate te Tensor.

EX:X, F=Function1._Generator()

where X is a list containing the grid in each dimention and
F is the Tensor created.
