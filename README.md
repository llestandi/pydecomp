In this project we try to build an easy to use library for decomposition of 
multiparameter Data. It is written in python and aims at being used by 
people that do not master the decomposition techniques but want to use it.

Example :
	- industrial partners
	- data compression for labmates

@TODO improve this readme
@TODO start documenting with sphynx
